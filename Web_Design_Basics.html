    <h1>Web Design Basics</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>The goal of this page will be to explain the basics involved in putting together a website. This will include, 
            but not be limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Tags to always include</li>
                <li>What to include within those tags</li>
                <li>Uh, more to come maybe?</li>
            </ul>
            This will likely not be all-inclusive and I probably should try to update this from time-to-time.
        </p>
        <h2>Basic tags to include when starting</h2>
        <div>
        <h3>DOCTYPE tag</h3>
        <p>This tag will tell the browser which version of HTML your page is using. For any of my own future concerns,
            that version will be HTML5. In order to use HTML5, the tag will look like:
        </p>
        <p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code></p>
        <p>At this point, using HTML5 is going to be better in the vast majority of cases. To see some of the 
            differences between HTML, HTML5, and XHTML, I would recommend going back and checking <a 
            href="https://hackr.io/blog/difference-between-html-html5-xhtml" target="_blank">this site</a>. Given my 
            own goals, HTML5's use on mobile devices makes it the best choice by a country mile.
        </p>
        <p>It's important to note that the DOCTYPE tag is self-closing.</p>
        <h3>html tag</h3>
        <p>Aside from any comments typed into the page, the html tag will come immediately after the DOCTYPE tag and 
            the last tag of the site will be the matching closing tag.
        </p>
        <h3>head tag</h3>
        <p>The head teag will come after the html tag and it will include meta-data for the site as well as the 
            title that appears in the top bar of the browser. It will get a closing tag that comes just before the 
            opening tag for the body.
        </p>
        <h3>title tag</h3>
        <p>The title tag will come within the head tags. Inside the opening and closing tags will simply be the title 
            of the site that appears in the toolbar of the browser.
        </p>
        <h3>body tag</h3>
        <p>Once the head tag has been closed, the body tag can be opened to include all the information on a site that 
            users will be coming to see. There will likely be most of the page <em>content</em> included within this 
            tag, even if the code of the page <em>code</em> comes before it's opened. This could be due to including 
            CSS or JavaScript in-line as well as various bits of meta-data.
